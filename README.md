Leetcode has more than 1300 problems in March 2020, the way to choose proper problem suits for me is hard, so base on suggestion form this [post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/522705/1000-LeetCode-Problems-within-a-Year), I write a simple program that given a problem number, it will returns next problem number.

Usage: next-leetcode number
